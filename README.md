<h1>This project was created as a personal project for boot.dev</h1>
<h2>About:</h2>
<p>Warcraft3CombatSimulator lets you take two units from base races (Human, Orc, Undead, Night Elf) to fight each other.
It allows for a quick check, whether a unit is good against the other and vice versa, without having to start, a match against the other player or CPU. Sadly the program doesn't include heroes and towers. I've spent a lot of time on it/procrastinating and I would like to move on with the course.</p>

<h2>Requirements:</h2>

`python3`

<h2>How to install and run:</h2>
<p> Note: if you are not using WSL for Windows, homebrew for Mac or Linux, I'm sorry but I don't know how to help you install and run it.</p>

`git copy https://github.com/JakubKyhos/Warcraft3CombatSimulator` run for installing

`cd Warcraft3CombatSimulator` get into folder

`python3 main.py` run the program

<h2>What to do after you run it:</h2>
<p>You will be presented with a list of units you can choose from.
type in the first unit you want or type quit to exit and press enter.
repeat for the second unit.
Depending on the units you chose you will be asked to select their upgrades.
If it`s [y/n] type y or n and hit enter.
If it`s something like basic, advanced or expert, type one of those choices and press enter. Or hit enter if you don't want any.
repeat for the second unit if needed</p>

<p>Now the program starts printing out how much damage each unit does and how much health, the enemy is left with.
Once one of the units dies you will get the victor and their remaining health.
If both units can't attack each other the program will inform you about it and stop.</p>

<p>Thank you for trying my program and I hope you didn't encounter any bugs.</p>
